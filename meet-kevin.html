As a dedicated father, he is a strong advocate for quality public education and a safe community with well-maintained infrastructure. Professionally, Kevin is committed to supporting thriving small businesses. Kevin works to strengthen connections between neighbors and build a more united, resilient community. Now, he’s ready to bring that same dedication and collaborative spirit to the Olathe City Council.</p><p><em>“When I moved to Olathe in 2003 I was looking for opportunity, and I found it. In Olathe I made friends that I still have today. I built a business doing managed IT services where I help other owners grow their business. I met my wife and started a family here. I found more than opportunity, I found community.</em></p><p><em> </em><em>Growing up my father and grandfather taught me how to be a good steward… of our home, our family, and ourselves. People have always known me as someone they can call if they need help with something. </em></p><p><em> </em><em>Today I think about my kids graduating and I know the opportunity I found when I moved here is less attainable today. I don’t want my kids to feel boxed in or blocked out when they decide how to start their adult life. I hear frequently from other people in Olathe who feel the same way. </em></p><p><em> </em><em>I continually teach my kids to be a good steward and give back when you can. My past experiences volunteering and helping others lead me to city council. When I look at Olathe I see a great place. A place where I built a life and started a family. Now I want to give back to the place I found community. I’m ready and able to serve.</em></p><p><em> </em><em>The past decades have shown incredible growth, but the next major phase of Olathe will look different than the past. Growth is slowing, prices are increasing, and people in Olathe are ready for a more vibrant, thriving destination for people in all stages of life. To live, raise a family, settle down, and to start afresh. Not only that, but it should be a destination to visit, shop, and dine as well. </em></p><p><em> </em><em>With thoughtfulness for the past and forward thinking we can take Olathe into vibrant, thriving future to build a better community together.”</em></p></div></article></main></div><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Kevin For Olathe - Treasurer Robert Winch</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://kevindeneault.github.io/k4o-site/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
